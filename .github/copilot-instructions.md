# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Commit message instructions

- Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages. Use the structure below: '<type>[optional scope]: <gitmoji> <description> [optional body]'.
- **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`) and optional scope to describe the affected module or feature.
- **Gitmoji**: Include a relevant `gitmoji` that best represents the nature of the change.
- **Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.
- **Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section, separating points with semicolons (`;`) for clarity. Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking."
- **Length** don't go over 72 characters if possible.
